# MagicCardDataCleaning
Data cleaning and normalization using Python pandas

A simple Python/Pandas project using Jupyter Notebook using the Magic card data set of the Streets of New Capenna.
The main objective of this project was just to get used to using pandas to explore and clean data. 
The biggest problem encountered was trying to assign values based on the "truthiness" of a series which Pandas did not like.
